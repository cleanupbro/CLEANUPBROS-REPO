## How Gift Cards Work

### For Customers:
1. Visit `/GiftCardPurchase` to buy a gift card
2. Fill in amount, recipient details
3. Receive email with Square payment link
4. After payment, receive digital gift card via email
5. Check balance at `/CheckBalance` with gift card code

### For Admin:
- Telegram notification for every purchase
- Gift cards stored in Supabase
- Track redemptions and balances
- Admin panel at `/AdminGiftCards`

---

## Database Tables

### gift_cards (Supabase)
```sql
- id, code, initial_amount, current_balance
- purchaser_name, purchaser_email, purchaser_phone
- recipient_name, recipient_email, gift_message
- is_gift, status, created_at, activated_at, expires_at
- square_payment_id
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Square Credentials in N8N** - Add Square API keys to N8N workflow
2. **Test Gift Card Purchase Flow** - End-to-end payment test
3. **Apply Supabase migrations** (if not done) for new tables
4. **Deploy to production** - Vercel or similar
